# 110borwein_2019

A first year Epitech math project done during the 2nd semester.
The goal of the project is to have a program that can test the Borwein integral for a given <code>n</code> value.

I advise searching about the Borwein integral on the internet but a nice explanation is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borwein_integral).

To summarize, this integral is told to approximate <code>Ï€/2</code> for any given <code>n</code> value.
The main issue will be to reproduce a mathematical integral in a program run by a computer.

## 3 different methods

We are told, for the project, to use 3 methods to reproduce the integral behavior.

* The midpoint method.
* The trapezoidal method.
* The Simpson method.
